
# Blazor Date Edit - Implement the date range selector

â›” DEPRECATED. This example was deprecated. 

Beginning with v24.1.3 and onward, we implemented the [Date Range Picker](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDateRangePicker-1) editor that allows users to select date ranges. Please check the [Date Range Picker demo](https://demos.devexpress.com/blazor/DateRangePicker) for details.

The current repository will not be updated in the future.
